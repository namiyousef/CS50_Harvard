# CS50_Harvard

My attempt at the Problem Sets of Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.

This is based on the 2019 iteration.

# Repository Contents:

### Files:
**CS50 Notes:**
  Notes that I took while attending the lectures for CS50.

### Directories:
**C_Code:**
  Includes the C scripts that I've written for the assignments of the course. Note that I've decided NOT to use the CS50 library provided by Harvard, and instead learn to do everything myself.
  **Note:** this process has actually been fairly insightful for me, since I've understood better how my computer works.

**Executables:**
  This includes the executable version of the C Scripts.
